    These two pictures are not of actual people...they are entirely computer generated.  NVIDIA released a paper in 2018 on using machine learning to take source training data and output realistic-looking faces.  It's beyond wild because they (for the most part) are well out of the uncanny valley-- you generally think they're real and they don't (generally) make you think they might be fake.  Think if it as a deep, deep fake.  Check it out at thispersondoesnotexist.com.  Each(ish) refresh will generate a brand new person that never existed in a photo that was never taken.  Future's here, folks, and it's pure nightmare fuel."
